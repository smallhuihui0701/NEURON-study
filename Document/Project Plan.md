# NEURON-Based Nerve Bundle Model

## 1. Introduction
This project aims to develop a simplified nerve bundle model using the **NEURON** simulation environment to study the effect of **Electrode** to **Compound Action Potential (CAP)**.

The model will begin with a **single nerve fiber** and progressively advance to a more complex **nerve bundle**. The stimulation methodology transitions from Patch Clamp to Point Electrode and ultimately to Surface Electrode. Recording techniques will evolve from Patch Clamp to Extracellular Patch.

The model will focus on **Axon**, omitting soma, dendritic structures, and neurotransmitter-mediated synaptic transmission.

## 2. Procedure
The project is divided into five distinct phases:
- **Phase I**: ***Single neuron fiber***, stimulation and recording via Patch Clamp.
- **Phase II**: Single neuron fiber, stimulation via Patch Clamp, recording via ***Extracellular Patch***.
- **Phase III**: Single neuron fiber, stimulation via ***Point Electrode*** (considering the distance between electrode and fiber), recording via Extracellular Patch.
- **Phase IV**: ***Nerve fiber bundle*** (considering fiber diameter variability), stimulation via Point Electrode (considering distance), recording via Extracellular Patch.
- **Phase V**: Nerve fiber bundle (considering fiber diameter variability), stimulation via ***Surface Electrode*** (considering charge density), recording via Extracellular Patch.

## 6. Outcome
The expected results from this project include:
- A stepwise approach to constructing a comprehensive CAP model.
- Insights into the effect of stimulation methods and electrode placement on signal propagation.
- A foundational framework for further extensions incorporating more physiological complexities.

## 7. Additional Information 
## 7.1 Stimulation Waveform
The simulation will incorporate different types of stimulation waveforms, including:
- **Single pulse stimulation**: A single short-duration stimulus.
- **Biphasic pulse stimulation**: Two-phase waveform for reducing charge accumulation.
- **Frequency-modulated stimulation**: A train of pulses with varying frequency to observe CAP response.

## 7.2 CAP Recording Methods
Different recording techniques will be used to capture the CAP response under various conditions:
- **Patch Clamp Recording**: Measures intracellular potential changes.
- **Extracellular Patch Recording**: Measures the field potential generated by nerve fiber activity.
- **Far-field Recording**: Examines CAP propagation over a distance using surface electrodes.

## 7.3 Experimental Variables
The following variables will be systematically varied to study their impact on CAP:
- **Electrode-fiber distance**: The distance between the stimulating electrode and nerve fiber (for Point and Surface electrodes).
- **Fiber diameter variability**: Different nerve fiber diameters will be considered in nerve bundle simulations.
- **Charge density variation**: For surface electrodes, different charge densities will be applied to study CAP generation and propagation.

## 7.4 Stimulation Parameters
Each stimulation experiment will be tested with different parameters:
- **Amplitude**: 0.1V to 5V (adjustable)
- **Duration**: 0.1 ms to 5 ms
- **Waveform Type**: Square pulse, Biphasic pulse, Sinusoidal stimulation


## 7.5 Data Analysis Methods
The recorded CAP signals will be analyzed using:
- **Peak amplitude and latency measurement**: Evaluating the CAP response magnitude and timing.
- **Frequency domain analysis**: Performing FFT to study the spectral components of CAP.
- **Comparative analysis**: Comparing CAP responses under different stimulation and recording conditions.
