100 Axial resistance myelinated [Ohm-cm]
200  Axial resistance unmyelinated [Ohm-cm]

0.01 Membrane capacitance myelinated in [µF/cm^2]
1.0   Membrane capacitance unmyelinated [µF/cm^2]

10e3       Distance from the stimulation electrode to the neuron (10 mm = 10,000 µm)
0.3          Extracellular conductivity [S/m], (brain tissue)  or
1,000     Extracellular tissue impedance [Ω]

Extracellular Stimulation Point Source Approximation 
The potential decays with distance according to the inverse distance law 

Vext = I / 4π σ r

I  is the stimulus current [nA]
σ is the extracellular conductivity [S/m]
r  is the distance from the electrode [µm]

or

Vext = I· Z / 4π r

r  is the distance from the electrode [µm]
Z is the tissue impedance [Ω]
